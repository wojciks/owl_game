# owl_game
Simplest game you can imagine...

## Libraries used
`pygame` obviously...

## Done so far:
* It runs!
* Owl is controllable - `up` and `down` buttons on keyboard move the owl up and down, `right` keyboard button makes the owl go faster, `left` makes it slow down, but using that you loose points!
* Scoring system - basing on how much distance owl traveled through the cave.
* Difficulty (speed) increases over time.

## Future plans:
* High scores.
* More challenging gameplay.
* Enemies? Shooting enemies?

## Issues:
* With speed increase obstacles are getting disconnected from one another, and even after starting a new game after game over remain disconnected. The more speed the bigger distortion. Slowing down is not helping!
* Python process with game running eats up CPU time lie crazy.
